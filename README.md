# Brain Tumor Classification - AI/ML Project

This AI/ML Project focuses on brain tumor classification using machine learning techniques. The project uses a dataset to train a neural network model that can classify brain tumor cases.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Brain_Tumor.csv` - Dataset containing brain tumor classification data
- `Project-2-Brain-Tumor.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with data analysis and model training
- `app-1.py` - Streamlit web application for interactive predictions
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Guide for adding files and contributing to the project

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- pip or conda for package management

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NoorHasan-714/Brain_Tumor_Classification-Ai-ML-Project.git
